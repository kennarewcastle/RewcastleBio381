## Why PLFA (Phospholipid Fatty Acids)?

- Microbes breakdown C substrates --> incorporate some of this C into their biomass
\bigskip
- Different classes of microbes have unique cell membrane components --> used to assess community structure
\bigskip
- Microbes that breakdown 13C labeled substrates incorporate this isotopic signature into their biomass
