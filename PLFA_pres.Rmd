## Why 13C-PLFA (Phospholipid Fatty Acids)?

- Microbes breakdown C substrates --> incorporate some of this C into their biomass
\bigskip
- Different classes of microbes have unique cell membrane components --> used to assess \color{red} community structure
\bigskip
- Microbes that breakdown 13C labeled substrates incorporate this isotopic signature into their biomass

## Conclusion: Advantages and Disadvantages of 13C-PLFA

>- Identifies the \textit{active} microbial community.
>- Shows the relative abundance of relatively broad taxonomic groups. 
>- Cheaper than RNA sequencing techniques, but still an expensive analysis with lower taxonomic resolution.
