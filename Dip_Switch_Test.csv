Rhizosphere Manipulation,Carbon Substrate Addition,Tree Type,Interpretation
+,+,+,"Decomposition is affected by the compexity of carbon-substrate inputs, microbial community struture, the presence or absence of key components of the rhizosphere, and the functional traits of the aboveground tree species."
-,+,+,Functional traits of tree species likely affect decomposition indirectly through their influence on soil physical properties. These relationships may depend on the relative complexity of carbon substrates available to the microbial community.
+,-,+,"All decomposition, regardless of the complexity of carbon substrates, is heavily influenced by the aboveground plant community, both through indirect impacts filtered through aboveground influence on soil physical properties and directly through the impact of the rhizosphere on belowground processes."
+,+,-,"The rhizsophere is an important influence on decomposition, possibly through the influence of extracellular enzymes produced by mycorrhizal fungi, or through the simple sugars released belowground through root exudation. Decomposition rates also depend on the complexity of carbon subtstrates, and this complexity might alter the relationship between the rhizosphere and decomposition."
-,-,+,"Decomposition is likely influenced predomoninantly by soil physical properties, with tree type indrectly influencing decomposition through litter inputs and the long-term influence of the rhizosphere on edaphic properties."
-,+,-,Decomposition rates are largely determined by the complexity of carbon inputs and are not significantly affected by the presence of roots and mycorrhizae or the functional traits of the above-ground community.
+,-,-,"Roots and mycorrhizae, regardless of aboveground tree species ID, affect degradation of carbon substrates across a spectrum of complexity."
-,-,-,"Decomposition is dominated by the influence of soil physical and biotic properties, and the influence of the rhizosphere and aboveground plants, if important at all, is indirectly mediated through soil properties."
