[Link](http://support.typora.io/Draw-Diagrams-With-Markdown/) for Typora Mermaid flowchart help.

[Tutorial](metafor_tutorial.html) for the `metafor` package that covers the basics of meta-analytical techniques and an introduction to fitting random-effects models to standardized mean difference data and transformed correlation coefficient data in a meta-analysis framework. [R markdown](metafor_tutorial.Rmd) file is also available.
