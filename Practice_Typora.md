Type in a bunch of text for us to work with. If you are a touch typist, you can do this pretty quickly! We will use this to illustrate formatting such as *italic*, **bold**,~~strikethrough~~, superscript^x^, and subscript~x~.

Markdown uses Latex to format math expressions. Dollar signs indicate math formatting.

$a=b+c$ stays with my text line like this.

$$
a=c+d

###subscripts in `markdown` vs `LaTex`

```
subscript~X~ 
```

```
$subscript_{X}$ 
```
$$
\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma + \delta_{X}}
$$

The double dollar signs above and below the code tells markdown to center a piece of LaTex math code.

On the class webpage, there is a cheatsheet that gives an overview of some of the LaTex commands.

Markdown has embedded languages to draw logic trees, diagrams, flow charts, etc, and we can work these into our HTML webpage.

Use "file —> export" to render your markdown file to a pdf.

LaTex editor for manuscript prep = overleaf. Overleaf has lots of good templates that have formatting already coded out for you, and you can insert your text into this pre-fab code.

LaTex uses a percentage sign for its comments. This means that you can annotate your manuscript without it showing up in the rendered manuscript—great for just leaving notes during the editing process.

LaTex/Overleaf doesn't really have the track-changes functionality, but you can address this by using different colors for different authors.
