```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) # This sets up echo/eval options GLOBALLY for all chunks in the rest of the file. Can override this default by specifying echo/eval in subsequent chunks.
```
Up above, include=FALSE hides that chunk of code from your output.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## More LaTex tricks

### Summation

$$\sum_{i=1}^S{n_i}=N$$

### Sentence text

$$p(\mbox{Occurrence of species X})=0.67$$

### Escaping the backslash

$$\backslash a \le b \backslash$$

Rendering code of \LaTeX

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
waterTemp<-runif(50)
planktonAbun<-runif(50)
qplot(x=waterTemp,y=planktonAbun) # qplot, unlike the ggplot function, does not require a dataframe
# print(waterTemp)
# head(waterTemp) # head() returns the first 6 entries in a vector to give you a peak at the contents
```

(Typing outside of the code fence puts you back in the world of `markdown`.)

Output from the print() function is deliberately prefaced with ## so that when copying and pasting code from a webpage, this output will not run with the rest of the code even if included in the destination script.

The echo=false line of code in the {} part of the code fence hides the lines of code when you knit the file, but the output is still rendered.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
qplot(x=waterTemp) # Without a y value, qplot produces a histogram of your data.
```

Using eval=FALSE tells computer to not run the code in that chunk when rendering file.

Using message=FALSE hides the warning messages that result from running the code from your HTML output.
